# Task Plan
1. Check bronze_cache dataset keys and contracts for 0DTE option MBO + statistics. [done]
2. Confirm bronze ingest stages read/write checkpoint partitions for 0DTE data. [done]
3. Mark IMPLEMENT.md task 1 as done. [done]
4. Run a minimal uv check to confirm bronze stage imports. [done]
5. Update batch_download_options.py to run flat-file batch requests from 2026-01-06 onward. [done]
6. Run batch_download_options.py via nohup for 2025-12-22 → 2026-01-21, submit-only with 1m pause and log job ids. [in progress]
7. Prevent duplicate batch submissions by reusing existing jobs. [done]
8. Derive 0DTE parent assets from definition files before MBO/statistics batch requests. [done]
9. Adjust HUD normalization window to 08:30–09:30 ET with 1 session lookback. [done]
10. Verify HUD normalization window change with a minimal uv check. [done]
11. Run 2026-01-06 pipeline stages end-to-end for UI replay. [in progress]
12. Run bronze future_option_mbo stages for a single 0DTE date to create cache. [in progress]
13. Re-run the same bronze job and confirm cache reuse by checking cache partition timestamps. [pending]
14. Mark IMPLEMENT.md task 4 as done. [pending]
15. Add technical README command list for IMPLEMENT.md progress. [done]
