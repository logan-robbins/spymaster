 Remember that there are multipe permutations of this (price approching from below moving up, price approaching from above moving down). Here we describe the moving up from below permuation. 

1) We create 2 minute candles.
2) If the candle closes within 5 points of the level above or below, we call that a TOUCH. 
3) We look 4 minutes ahead.
4) If a trade closes  > 5 points above the level in the next 4 minutes without having a trade close more than 5 points below the level, that is a BREAK_UP
5) if at any time, a trade closes 5 points below the level in that 4 minutes, that is considered a BOUNCE_DOWN because it would break a day traders stop loss. 
6) if a trade closes  > 10 points without reretreating 5 points below the level, that is a BREAK_UP_STRONG

The same is true for the reverse moving downards:
- BREAK_DOWN
- BREAK_DOWN_STRONG
- BOUNCE_UP
