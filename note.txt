<environment>
Python tooling: `uv` (exclusive)
Apple M4 Silicon 128GB Ram
ALL python work happens in backend/
ALL angular work happens in frontned/
</environment>

<python_tooling>
Use `uv` for all Python operations:
- Run scripts: `uv run script.py`
- Run tests: `uv run pytest`
- Add packages: `uv add package`

The `.venv` directory is the single source of truth for dependencies. Do not use `pip`, raw `python`, or manual `venv` commands.
</python_tooling>

<workflow>
Follow this sequence always:

1. **Discover**: Search the codebase for existing patterns, utilities, or similar implementations before creating new files. Prefer extending existing code over creating new files.

2. **Plan**: Create a LIVING document that outlines the numbered items of the plan for the task. This document should be updated as the task progresses.

3. **Implement**: Write a single, direct implementation. If prerequisites are unmet, fail fast with a clear error. We NEVER skip "hard" work, we do everything with maximum effort.

4. **Verify**: Run minimal tests or commands locally with `uv run <command>` to confirm the implementation works. We will test more as requested.

5. **Update**: Update the task document with MINIMAL comments to reflect the status of the item in the task list. 
</workflow>

<code_principles>
- Search first: Before creating any new file, search for existing patterns and utilities
- Single implementation: Create one canonical solution without fallback or optional code paths
- Fail fast: Return clear errors when prerequisites are missing
**WE IGNORE / OVERWRITE ALL EXISTING CODE COMMENTS, they are considered outdated**
**WE NEVER WRITE optional, legacy, update, fallback code -- we destroy anything and rewrite it if it doesn't accomplish our goals or is outdated based on new specs**
**WE NEVER WRITE versions of code or schemas unless directly requested-- all changes SHOULD BE BREAKING and canonical**
</code_principles>

<output_constraints>
WE NEVER CREATE "summary" markdown files, "final guide" markdown files, or any documentation artifacts unless explicitly requested.

Summaries belong in your response text, not in separate files.

Do not include code blocks in summaries or markdown unless specifically requested.
</output_constraints>

<response_format>
End substantive responses with a brief summary (in your response, not a file):
```
Summary:
- What was done
- What is next
```

No code in summaries. Skip summaries for simple questions.

## Platform Vision (Not Fact, Just Desire)

This is a platform specifically built to visualize market/dealer physics in the first 3 hours of trading (when volume is the highest). The goal is not to predict price, but to retrieve similar setups and their labeled outcomes.

SETUP*.png images are perfect examples of what we are trying to model.

Core value prop for the trader:
"I am watching PM High at 6800. Price is approaching from below. I see call and long physics outpacing put/short physics at 6799 showing that people expect the price go above. At the same time, I see call/long physics at 6800 outpacing put/short physics. At the same time, I see call/long physics at 6801 outpacing put/short physics. BUT At 6802, I see MASSIVE put/short/resting limit sells. Representing both negative sentiment/positioning, and massive liquidity increasing that will make it tough for the price to go above 6802."

We answer that specific question in both directions, for 4–5 key levels (not every single point/strike). The exhaustive feature permutations in both directions are important for our model. This must be in the core of every line of code we write.

The price of ES Futures is moving up toward a level (Pre‑Market High) shortly after market open. Using 2‑minute candles, I see a clear rejection where the price retreats sharply back down from this very specific level. The level was pre‑determined. Trades close just at the level, then immediately shoot back down.

Because this pattern can be observed multiple times, I posit these are hints/traces of machines or humans following algorithms. Before the price can reject back down, a discrete list of things must happen for it to be physically possible:

1) The asks above the level must move higher
2) The resting sell orders above the level must have cancels/pulls faster than sell orders are added
3) The bids below the level must move lower
4) The orders below the level must have cancels/pulls faster than buy orders are added

Without this, it is physically impossible to move lower. Without #3 and #4, the price would continue to chase the ask higher and the price would move through the level. If any one of these does not happen, you will get chop/consolidation/indecision. The exact same is true of the opposite direction. The core question is: will it break through the level (relative to the direction of travel) and continue, or will it reject from the level (relative to the direction of travel).

I am only interested in identifying these signatures between the time they happen and before retail traders can react. This is not HFT (though it could be later). For now, slight latency is fine.

I posit there exists a function/algorithm (hybrid or ensemble likely) that describes the market state required and triggers the automated/institutional or human TA algorithms to execute. For example, the TA community may see a break above the 15‑minute opening range level, a slight move back down toward the level (but not through it), and at that moment decide "It broke and retested the opening range → it’s going to run higher." That is a simple algorithm not informed by what is actually happening with items 1–4 above. When TA traders see failure, they may flip to "fake test" and sell. These inefficiencies are what we aim to expose or exploit.

**IMPORTANT** 
- YOU ONLY work in the spymaster/ workspace. 
- YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ ANY OTHER MD DOCUMENTS unless instructed, they are probably out of date.
- ALL CODE IS CONSIDERED OLD/outdated, YOU CAN OVERWRITE/EXTEND TO ACCOMPLISH YOUR TASK without making notes or versions
- You have full power to regenerate data when you need to except for lake/raw/* data
- use backend/.venv/bin/ for python commands

read @IMPLEMENT.md in it's entirety, do not skip. Then read README.md and continue working until IMPLEMENT.md is complete.
