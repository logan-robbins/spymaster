## 11) The “why” in one sentence (so the agent doesn’t lose the plot)

You built Bronze/Silver/Gold so that **raw events → conserved primitives → normalized field**, and the next evolution is to treat that field as a **spatiotemporal medium** where:

* **ρ/ν** define obstacles and damping
* **pressure_grad** defines directional push
* multi‑scale filters create “waves”
* a simple driven-damped particle model yields **interpretable lookahead**

That’s exactly the bridge from “pretty velocity heatmap” to “actionable, explainable microstructure prediction.”  

Task Plan - Frontend composite validation (2026-01-29)
1) [x] Inspect futures composite shader inputs and logic
2) [x] Trace websocket fields into grid buffers
3) [x] Check options grid rendering for composite vs velocity-only
4) [x] Update README to reflect current composite state
5) [x] Deliver report with concrete code references and gaps
